# Marcel-Engine-Packaging-Kit
This is a small kit I made for packaging and unpacking games from Marcel Engine


How it works is:
You can take your game made with Marcel Engine. (The exe should be in a folder and all the essential files it needs too!)
Then use the packager and select the exe.
it will give you a packaged file that you can open!

You can also use the installer so you can easily open and run the package files!

Just unpack the installer zip and run the installer
